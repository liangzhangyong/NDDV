class LeNet(TorchClassMixin, TorchPredictMixin):
    """LeNet-5 convolutional neural net classifier.

    Consists of 2 5x5 convolution kernels and a MLP classifier. LeNet-5 was one of the
    earliest conceived CNNs and was typically applied to digit analysis. LeNet-5 can but
    doesn't generalize particularly well to higher dimension (such as color) images.

    gray_scale : bool, optional

        as well with color, so disable gray_scale at your own risk, by default True
